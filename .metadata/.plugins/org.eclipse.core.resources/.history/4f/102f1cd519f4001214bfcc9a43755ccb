Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_MeasureChan -This method performs measurement on one channel. (Note: If the <number of conversions> is more than one 
                the conversion of the A/D channel is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels justified to the left. Compared with 
                <GetValue> method this method returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and 
                <AD resolution> is less than 16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - AD1_GetChanValue16 -This method returns the last measured value of the required channel justified to the left. Compared 
                with <GetChanValue> method this method returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater 
                than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is 
                eliminated.

Module "sampleTimer" (component TimerInt)
   - sampleTimer_Enable -This method enables the component - it starts the timer. Events may be generated 
                (<DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>).
   - sampleTimer_Disable -This method disables the component - it stops the timer. No events will be generated.

Module "filterTimer" (component TimerOut)

Module "accelerometerSleep" (component BitIO)
   - accelerometerSleep_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is 
                read and returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - accelerometerSleep_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value 
                to a memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - accelerometerSleep_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - accelerometerSleep_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "Cpu"       (component MC9S08JM60_64)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
