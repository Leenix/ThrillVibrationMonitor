Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_MeasureChan -This method performs measurement on one channel. (Note: If the <number of conversions> is more than one 
                the conversion of the A/D channel is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels justified to the left. Compared with 
                <GetValue> method this method returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and 
                <AD resolution> is less than 16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - AD1_GetChanValue16 -This method returns the last measured value of the required channel justified to the left. Compared 
                with <GetChanValue> method this method returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater 
                than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is 
                eliminated.

Module "sampleTimer" (component TimerInt)
   - sampleTimer_Enable -This method enables the component - it starts the timer. Events may be generated 
                (<DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>).
   - sampleTimer_Disable -This method disables the component - it stops the timer. No events will be generated.

Module "filterTimer" (component TimerOut)

Module "SDSerial"  (component SynchroMaster)
   - SDSerial_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does 
                not wait for data).   For information about SW overrun behavior please see <General info page>.
   - SDSerial_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel.
   - SDSerial_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer.  Note: If the Interrupt service is 
                disabled, and the Ignore empty character is set to yes, and a character has been received, then this method 
                returns 1 although it was an empty character.
   - SDSerial_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer.
   - SDSerial_GetError -Returns a set of errors on the channel (errors that cannot be returned in given methods). The component 
                accumulates errors in a set; after calling [GetError] this set is returned and cleared. This method is 
                available only if the "Interrupt service/event" property is enabled.

Module "Cpu"       (component MC9S08JM60_64)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
